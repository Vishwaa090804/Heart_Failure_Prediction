**Machine Learning-Powered Clinical Decision Support**

A sophisticated medical AI tool that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict heart failure risk based on patient clinical data, laboratory values, and demographic information.

## 📋 Overview

The Heart Failure Risk Predictor is designed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at high risk of heart failure through comprehensive data analysis. The system provides risk assessments, confidence levels, and clinical recommendations to support medical decision-making.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Risk Assessment
- **High-Accuracy Predictions**: ML model with confidence scoring
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant risk calculation upon data input
- **Risk Stratification**: Clear categorization (Critical Risk, High Risk, Moderate Risk, Low Risk)
- **Death Event Prediction**: Advanced mortality risk assessment

### 📊 Comprehensive Input Parameters
- **Demographic Information**: Age, Sex
- **Clinical Parameters**: 
  - Ejection Fraction (%)
  - Follow-up Time (days)
  - Medical History (Anemia, High Blood Pressure, Diabetes, Smoking)
- **Laboratory Values**:
  - Creatinine Phosphokinase (mcg/L)
  - Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)
  - Platelets (kiloplatelets/mL)
  - Serum Sodium (mEq/L)

### 📈 Results Dashboard
- **Risk Percentage**: Clear numerical risk assessment
- **Model Confidence**: Transparency in prediction reliability
- **Key Risk Factors**: Ranked contribution analysis
- **Clinical Recommendations**: Actionable medical guidance

    "model_confidence": 87,
    "death_event_prediction": "Yes",
    "key_risk_factors": [
        {"factor": "Ejection Fraction", "contribution": 85},
        {"factor": "Serum Creatinine", "contribution": 72},
        {"factor": "Anaemia", "contribution": 65}
    ],
    "clinical_recommendations": [
        "Emergency medical evaluation needed",
        "Consider ICU admission",
        "Aggressive treatment protocol",
        "Daily monitoring essential",
        "Advanced heart failure team consultation"
    ]
}
```

## 🏥 Clinical Recommendations System

The system provides evidence-based recommendations based on risk levels:

- **Critical Risk (>80%)**: Emergency intervention protocols
- **High Risk (60-80%)**: Intensive monitoring and treatment
- **Moderate Risk (40-60%)**: Regular follow-up and preventive measures
- **Low Risk (<40%)**: Standard care protocols
